## Introduction

This package contains functions that I use often in projects.

### Installation

`devtools::install_github('tonyelhabr/fsquads')`.

## Notes

Here is a list of all functions in the package.

    #> [1] "get_league_teams_meta" "get_leagues_meta"      "get_team_players"

## TODO

\[ \] Remove dependencies.

\[ \] Re-consider the need for memoization.

\[ \] Make better documentation.

## Examples

Unfortunately, none (right now).
